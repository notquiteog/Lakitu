"""Open neural rendering's wiring, in the source: what no frame-level check can see.

* the open backend reads the Neural tab live: its asked() and apply() go through nr_settings() every call and hold
  no static copy of it (the upscaling rows once shipped dead that way; tests/test_nr_settings_live.py is the same
  check for the Streamline backend);
* dlssnr::apply hands the frame to it when it is selected, in BOTH of its builds -- the Streamline one and the stubs
  every other build (Linux's) compiles. A dispatch in only one would leave the backend unreachable on the other
  platform and nothing would say so;
* create_device asks it for its extensions before vkCreateDevice and chains its features before the features query,
  and it is told when the device exists;
* opennr::selected() takes the Backend row's fourth value, Open, and RX_VK_NR_BACKEND (no MERGE marker left).
