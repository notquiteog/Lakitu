"""The open neural rendering backend's khr route (gpu/vk/opennr/khr: VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix alone, the route AMD's
GPUs run), quick form: scripts/opennr_harness.py run --khr on the synthetic model and frame at 384x256, every khr
variant on every device here that can run one, each on a device made with nothing but what that route needs, against
the references of upstream's GLSL route, and block 0 against the CPU reference.

What a PC here can have: an NVIDIA GPU (the references, and the khr variants its driver lists the shapes for) and
llvmpipe (Mesa's CPU driver: KHR matrices, no NV extension, no E4M3 -- the f16 variant at 8 lanes, a couple of
minutes). Without a GPU that runs upstream's routes the references come from a khr run; without any device that runs
either, without Vulkan, a compiler or the Vulkan headers, it says SKIP and passes.
