"""Open neural rendering's correctness harness, the quick form: OpenDLSS-NR on this GPU on a synthetic model and frame,
every route against the GLSL reference route bit for bit and block 0 against the CPU reference
(scripts/opennr_harness.py says how, and why synthetic: there are no real weights to test with, anywhere).

Without a GPU that has the network's extensions (VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix, VK_NV_cooperative_matrix2,
VK_EXT_shader_float8), without Vulkan, or without a compiler or the Vulkan headers, it says SKIP and passes: CI has no
such GPU. On a PC that has one it takes about twenty seconds.

    python -I -B tests/test_opennr_harness.py --cxx clang++ --headers <Vulkan-Headers include folder>
