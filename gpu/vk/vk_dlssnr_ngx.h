// (hookshot) DLSS 5 neural rendering through NGX directly: the same model as gpu/vk/vk_dlssnr.h, without Streamline.
//
// NGX knows the feature as NVSDK_NGX_Feature_Reserved18. The public SDK names nothing else about it -- no capability keys,
// no parameters -- so the parameter set below is the one openNR (https://github.com/clshortfuse/openNR, MIT, Copyright
// 2026 Carlos Lopez) drives it with in its native benchmark: the names are facts about the feature, written out here; none
// of openNR's code is copied. Nothing of NVIDIA's is in this repository, and nothing here reads or patches NVIDIA's files.
//
// Why a second path to the same model:
//  - Windows without Streamline. sl.dlss_nr's own checks may refuse an RTX 20, 30 or 40 even where the model itself (a
//    community-patched nvngx_dlssnr.dll) would run on it; through NGX, the only gate is the one inside that file.
//  - Linux. Streamline is Windows-only, but NGX is not: the Linux NGX core loads features as libnvidia-ngx-<name>.so* and
//    already answers for DLSS-NR's capability keys. What is missing, as of SDK 310.9.16 and driver 615, is NVIDIA's
//    libnvidia-ngx-dlssnr.so itself. Until it ships this path says so plainly; the day it does, it should simply run.
//
// It shares the one NGX session DLSS super resolution owns (dlss_ngx_session, gpu/vk/vk_dlss.h; gpu/vk/vk_ngx.h says why
// there is one), and it is fed exactly what the Streamline path is fed: the finished frame, a flat depth, no motion.
//
// `nr::` below is which of the two runs: the Insert menu's Neural tab "Backend" row (opts.nr_backend: Auto, Streamline, NGX
// direct), or RX_VK_DLSS_NR_BACKEND=auto|streamline|ngx over it. Auto takes Streamline where it is attached and NGX direct
// otherwise, which on Linux is always.
