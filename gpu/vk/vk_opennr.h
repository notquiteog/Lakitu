// (hookshot) Open neural rendering: the DLSS 5 neural rendering network run by OpenDLSS-NR, without NVIDIA's runtime.
//
// The third backend behind the Neural tab, beside Streamline (gpu/vk/vk_dlssnr.cpp) and NGX direct. Streamline runs
// NVIDIA's own model through NVIDIA's own DLLs and is Windows-only; this runs a bit-exact Vulkan reimplementation of
// the same network (https://github.com/maanHimself/OpenDLSS-NR, MIT, vendored in third_party/opendlss-nr) on the
// renderer's own device, so it runs natively on Linux too. On an NVIDIA card with VK_NV_cooperative_matrix2 it runs
// upstream's kernels; anywhere else with VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix -- AMD's RDNA 3 and 4 above all -- it runs the khr
// route (gpu/vk/opennr/khr: upstream's unfused graph on kernels that need only the KHR matrices, docs/neural-rendering.md).
//
// THE WEIGHTS ARE THE PLAYER'S. The network reads a model directory -- manifest.json and its stage files, upstream's
// docs/weights.md -- that nothing public produces, and Hookshot provides no way to get one: nothing here extracts,
// converts or downloads model data. RX_VK_OPENNR_MODEL=<dir> names it, else `nr-model` in the game folder. Without
// one the log and the menu say so and every frame goes to the window as it always did.
//
// Same place and contract as the other backends: do_present (vk_replay.cpp) calls nr::apply on the finished frame at
// display size, once for each of the game's frames and before frame generation or the menu, and nr::apply hands the
// frame here when this backend is the one that runs. Everything is recorded into that frame's command buffer; nothing is allocated per frame.
