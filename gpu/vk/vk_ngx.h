// (hookshot) The one NGX session the DLSS backends share.
//
// NGX initializes once per process and hands back one capability-parameter block for every feature
// it knows, so backends that each loaded and initialized it would each be a bug: a second
// NVSDK_NGX_VULKAN_Init over a live session, a second set of parameters, and a shutdown by whichever
// one finished first. The session is gpu/vk/vk_dlss.cpp's (super resolution and frame generation, both
// upstream's, are made there); DLSS 5 neural rendering through NGX (gpu/vk/vk_dlssnr_ngx.h) comes
// through here and owns nothing but its own feature handle.
//
// Nothing of NVIDIA's is in this repository and nothing of NVIDIA's is needed to build it: this
// whole file is inside the build-time gate `HOOKSHOT_NGX`, which names the builder's own copy of
// an NGX SDK. A tree without it does not compile this file at all, and the backends' public headers
// stay free of NGX types so that the renderer can call them either way. docs/upscaling.md has the
// licensing decision in full.
