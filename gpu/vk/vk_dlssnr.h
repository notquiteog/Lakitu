// (hookshot) DLSS 5 neural rendering (DLSS-NR): NVIDIA's model over the finished frame.
//
// What it is, because the name invites the wrong guess: DLSS-NR is *not* ray reconstruction. Ray
// reconstruction (sl.dlss_d / NGX's DLSSD) denoises a ray-traced image and needs a G-buffer, albedo,
// normals and roughness, which a 2026 recompilation of a 1998 game does not have and never will.
// DLSS-NR is an "uplift" pass: Streamline's own headers name its buffers
// kBufferTypeUpliftInputColor and kBufferTypeUpliftOutputColor, and the only other things it is
// handed are depth and motion vectors. Colour in, colour out. That is why it runs on rasterized
// content at all, and it is why it can sit here, at the end of the frame, over the picture the
// renderer is about to show -- which is where RenoDX and dlss5-anywhere put it too.
//
// So this backend does not touch the 3D scene. It takes the window's image, hands it to the model,
// and gives back the image to present in its place. Depth and motion are tagged because Streamline
// asks for them, with a flat depth and no motion: at this point in the frame the picture is already
// upscaled and already has the HUD on it, so the scene's real depth buffer does not describe it and
// feeding it would be a lie the model would act on.
//
// Windows only -- see gpu/vk/vk_streamline.h for why, and for the licensing: nothing of NVIDIA's is
// in this repository and nothing of NVIDIA's is linked. On every other build each function here
// answers "no" and the frame goes to the window as it always did.
