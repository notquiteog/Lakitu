"""The open neural rendering backend's kernels: OpenDLSS-NR's SPIR-V and PTX, and the frame's own two passes.

Three kinds of file, made three ways, for reasons that are not the same:

* OpenDLSS-NR's thirteen GLSL kernels (third_party/opendlss-nr/shaders) are compiled with the flags of upstream's
  scripts/build_shaders.ps1 and checked in as one header, gpu/vk/shaders/opennr_kernels_spv.h -- like every other
  shader in gpu/vk/shaders, so a clone builds without glslang;
* the renderer's own preprocess and composite passes (gpu/vk/shaders/opennr_pre.comp, opennr_post.comp) the same
  way, one glslang header each, the way the rest of gpu/vk/shaders is made;
* the PTX kernels are generated at build time by nx2/build.py from upstream's Python generators
  (third_party/opendlss-nr/scripts/ptx), with exactly the calls build_shaders.ps1 makes. They are text, the
  generators need only Python, which every build has, and checking in 5.5 MB of generated text would only be a
  second copy of the generators to keep in step.

    python -I -B scripts/opennr_kernels.py              # write the SPIR-V headers
    python -I -B scripts/opennr_kernels.py --check      # compare instead of writing (tests/test_opennr_kernels.py)
    python -I -B scripts/opennr_kernels.py --materialize DIR
        # DIR/shaders/*.spv from the CHECKED-IN header and DIR/ptx/*.ptx freshly generated: the kernel folder
        # OpenDLSS-NR's host code reads, for the correctness harness (scripts/opennr_harness.py). The SPIR-V comes
        # from the header on purpose: the harness proves what ships, not a fresh compile of it.
    python -I -B scripts/opennr_kernels.py --prepare DIR
        # upstream's host sources copied to DIR with SOURCE_PATCHES applied (what nx2/build.py and the harness compile)

The khr route (gpu/vk/opennr/khr, for GPUs without VK_NV_cooperative_matrix2: AMD's, llvmpipe) is a fourth kind, made
like the first: checked in as gpu/vk/shaders/opennr_khr_spv.h. Its kernel folders hold, per variant (KHR_VARIANTS):
the four matrix kernels written for VK_KHR_cooperative_matrix (gpu/vk/opennr/khr/*.comp, compiled with the variant's
defines); upstream's ops, gemm_reduce, window_normalize and global_normalize compiled from build-time copies with their
hardware E4M3 conversions spelled in integers and their half fma, inverse square root and f32-to-half conversions
made exact (KHR_SOURCE_PATCHES, gpu/vk/opennr/khr/khr_e4m3.glsl and khr_numerics.glsl); upstream's preprocess as it is
(the same module as the other routes'); and a module that does nothing for the four fused kernels, which the khr
route's unfused graph never dispatches.
